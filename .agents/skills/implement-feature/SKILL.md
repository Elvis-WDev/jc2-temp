# Implement Feature

## Context To Load

Read:

- `AGENTS.md`
- Nearest scoped `AGENTS.md`, if present.
- Relevant feature spec under `docs/product/features/`.
- `docs/quality/definition-of-done.md`
- Relevant architecture document under `docs/architecture/`.
- `docs/architecture/stack.md`

## Workflow

1. Identify the feature specification and acceptance criteria.
2. If the task is non-trivial, create or update a plan in `docs/plans/active/`.
3. Update domain concepts first when business rules change.
4. Add or update application ports/interfaces before infrastructure adapters.
5. For backend work, use Express controllers/routes, Zod validation, Better Auth middleware, Prisma repositories, and typed Axios clients when needed.
6. For frontend work, use Next.js, shadcn/ui, React Hook Form, Zod, typed API helpers, and clear loading/error states.
7. Update generated references when contracts change.
8. Update feature decisions or ADRs when architecture changes.
9. Run the project verification command.

## Guardrails

- Keep domain code framework-free.
- Do not pass HTTP request/response objects into use cases.
- Keep response and error shapes consistent with architecture docs.
- Do not expose secrets to the frontend or logs.
- Do not implement custom auth when Better Auth covers the need.
- Do not bypass Prisma migrations for schema changes.
- Do not use npm or yarn.
