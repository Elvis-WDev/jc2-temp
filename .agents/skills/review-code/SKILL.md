# Review Code

## Context To Load

Read:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/quality/code-review.md`
- Relevant architecture docs.
- Relevant feature specification and acceptance criteria.
- `docs/architecture/stack.md`

## Review Stance

Lead with findings. Prioritize:

1. Bugs and data loss.
2. Security and auth issues.
3. Behavioral regressions.
4. Missing tests or verification.
5. Architecture drift.

Stack-specific checks:

- Auth uses Better Auth instead of custom password/session logic.
- Database changes use Prisma migrations and PostgreSQL-compatible assumptions.
- Package manager usage stays on pnpm/Corepack.
- External HTTP calls are server-side, typed, and use Axios when tokens are involved.
- Frontend forms use React Hook Form and Zod.

## Output Format

- Findings first, ordered by severity.
- Include file and line references.
- Add open questions after findings.
- Keep summaries secondary.

If no issues are found, say so clearly and mention residual risk.
