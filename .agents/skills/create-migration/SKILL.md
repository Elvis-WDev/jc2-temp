# Create Migration

## Context To Load

Read:

- `docs/architecture/database.md`
- `docs/architecture/stack.md`
- Relevant feature spec.
- `docs/security/principles.md`
- Current migration policy for the project.

## Workflow

1. Understand the data model change and affected workflows.
2. Decide whether the migration is additive, destructive, or data-transforming.
3. Add schema changes using the project's migration tool.
4. Update repositories and application DTOs.
5. Update generated database documentation.
6. Validate with typecheck/tests/migration verification.

## Guardrails

- Destructive changes require an explicit data plan.
- Production credentials should not stay overprivileged after initial setup.
- Generated database clients or schema references must be regenerated, not hand edited.
- PostgreSQL is the production target.
- Prisma migrations are the default schema-change mechanism.
