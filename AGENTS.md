# Project Agent Guide

## Project

`{{PROJECT_NAME}}` is a TypeScript application built with:

- Node.js.
- Express.js REST API.
- Next.js frontend.
- Better Auth for authentication.
- PostgreSQL as the primary database.
- Prisma for ORM and migrations.
- Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for UI.
- React Hook Form and Zod for forms.
- Axios for external HTTP integrations.
- pnpm through Corepack as the only package manager.

## Read Before Working

- Product overview: `docs/product/overview.md`
- Architecture map: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Architecture details: `docs/architecture/index.md`
- Stack baseline: `docs/architecture/stack.md`
- Authentication: `docs/architecture/authentication.md`
- Frontend architecture: `docs/architecture/frontend.md`
- Interface design: `docs/architecture/interface-design.md`
- Active plans: `docs/plans/active/`
- Definition of done: `docs/quality/definition-of-done.md`
- Frontend review checklist: `docs/quality/frontend-checklist.md`
- Security principles: `docs/security/principles.md`

## Workflow

1. Read this file and the nearest `AGENTS.md` for the files you will touch.
2. Open only the relevant docs for the current task.
3. For non-trivial work, create or update a plan in `docs/plans/active/`.
4. Implement the smallest coherent change.
5. Update documentation when behavior, architecture, API, data, or decisions change.
6. Run the project's verification commands before calling work complete.

## Required Verification

Use pnpm through Corepack. Replace placeholders only when the project exposes different script names:

- Install: `corepack pnpm install`
- Format: `corepack pnpm format`
- Lint: `corepack pnpm lint`
- Test: `corepack pnpm test`
- Typecheck: `corepack pnpm typecheck`
- Build: `corepack pnpm build`
- Full validation: `corepack pnpm verify`

## Constraints

- Do not put product or architecture knowledge in `.codex/`.
- Always use pnpm through Corepack; never use npm or yarn in this repository.
- Use Better Auth for authentication; do not hand-roll password hashing, login flows, or session storage.
- Use PostgreSQL as the primary production database.
- Use Prisma migrations for database schema changes.
- Use environment variables for configuration and validate them at startup.
- Keep provider tokens and secrets server-side.
- Do not introduce production dependencies without documenting why.
- Do not modify generated files manually.
- Do not bypass validation at HTTP, environment, auth, database, or external-service boundaries.
- Do not mark work complete while verification is failing.
- Keep secrets out of committed files.
- Do not expose internal IDs, provider names, storage paths, auth implementation details, or other technical references in product UI when a business-facing label or automatic backend value is possible.
- Reuse the documented table, form, dialog, feedback, navigation, and responsive patterns instead of inventing a different interaction model per module.
- Optimize operational screens for scanning and repeated work. Remove redundant summaries, duplicated headings, explanatory boxes, and nested cards that do not help the user decide or act.

## Definition Of Done

Implementation, verification, documentation, and acceptance criteria must agree.
