# Testing Strategy

## Test Pyramid

- Unit tests for pure domain logic.
- Use-case tests for application behavior.
- Integration tests for database, HTTP, auth, and external boundaries.
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows.

## What Must Be Tested

- Validation boundaries.
- Auth and permissions.
- Error responses.
- Data persistence.
- Background jobs and cancellation.
- External service failure modes.
- Better Auth protected-route behavior.
- Prisma repository behavior for critical writes.
- PostgreSQL migration assumptions.
- React Hook Form validation paths.
- Table search, filters, sorting, pagination, column visibility, and row actions.
- Modal focus management, dismissal, scroll containment, and submission states.
- Toast semantics and retry behavior for successful and failed actions.
- Responsive layout, long text, empty collections, large collections, and dark mode.
- Permission-driven navigation and action visibility.

## Test Data

- Use deterministic fixtures.
- Avoid real secrets.
- Avoid relying on unstable external services in CI.
- Mock external APIs behind typed client ports.
