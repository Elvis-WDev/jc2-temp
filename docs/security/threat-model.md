## Threats

| Threat | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Token leakage | Provider abuse | Keep tokens server-side and out of logs. |
| Unauthorized data access | Privacy breach | Enforce auth middleware and permission checks. |
| Unvalidated bulk input | Data corruption | Validate, chunk, and report progress. |
| Hand-rolled authentication | Account compromise | Use Better Auth and documented auth middleware. |
| Overprivileged database user | Production data loss | Reduce privileges after migrations. |
| External outage | Workflow failure | Normalize errors and expose retry-safe states. |
