# Frontend Architecture

## Runtime

- Framework: Next.js.
- Language: TypeScript.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with semantic theme tokens.
- Component system: shadcn/ui.
- Icons: lucide-react.
- Form handling: React Hook Form and Zod.
- Data tables: TanStack Table behind one shared application component.
- Feedback: one shared semantic toast system.
- Data fetching: typed API helpers over internal backend routes.
- Charts: shadcn-compatible chart components when a chart answers a real question.

## Product UI Principle

Build the working product as the first screen. Operational applications should feel
quiet, predictable, and efficient for repeated use. The interface exists to help a
person scan, compare, decide, and act; it should not advertise its own implementation.

Do not treat every dataset as a dashboard, every section as a card, or every action as
a permanent panel. Choose the smallest surface that supports the workflow.

## Required Pattern Documents

Open only the documents relevant to the task:

- Screen hierarchy and visual workload: `interface-design.md`.
- Shared component inventory and contracts: `component-system.md`.
- Lists, filters, columns, actions, and pagination: `data-tables.md`.
- Forms, selectors, modals, drawers, and full-page workflows: `forms-and-workflows.md`.
- Toasts, validation, loading, empty, error, and background-job states: `feedback-and-states.md`.
- Sidebar, header, permissions, mobile, touch, and themes: `navigation-responsive.md`.
- Completion audit: `../quality/frontend-checklist.md`.

## State Ownership

- Server state: typed query/mutation helpers with cancellation and invalidation.
- Form state: React Hook Form.
- Validation: shared Zod schemas where client/server contracts permit reuse.
- Local UI state: transient interaction only, such as an open dialog or temporary selection.
- URL state: shareable search, filters, sorting, page, and active views when useful.
- Persisted job state: backend-owned when work must survive navigation, refresh, or closing a modal.

Do not mirror the same state across URL, form, component, and server caches without a
single declared owner.

## Component Policy

1. Reuse an existing product component.
2. Compose shadcn/ui primitives.
3. Add a shared application component when at least two workflows need the same contract.
4. Create a module-specific component only when its behavior is genuinely domain-specific.

External registries may provide a starting point, but inspect installed code, remove
demo assumptions, map colors to project tokens, verify accessibility, and align it with
the existing component contract before use. Do not accumulate near-duplicate primitives.

## Technical Information Boundary

The frontend may carry internal IDs in values and requests, but should present labels,
names, references, or searchable selectors. Backend-generated identifiers, database
keys, provider names, storage locations, secret references, framework names, and raw
metadata stay hidden unless the user has a documented operational reason to inspect them.

Audit or developer tools may expose technical detail, but must remain permission-gated
and visually distinct from normal product workflows.

## Verification Baseline

Before completion, exercise the screen with:

- realistic, empty, loading, partial, failure, and unauthorized data;
- long labels, long names, and the smallest supported viewport;
- keyboard-only navigation and visible focus;
- light and dark themes;
- repeated submit clicks, slow requests, and stale responses;
- the shared frontend checklist.
